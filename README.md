# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition - JavaScript

## Instructions

- This repository contains coding explaination and solutions on questions listed in the book.

- So far, codes are available for the first 4 chapters.

- Under each JavaScript file, there are tests to check that the code is working as expected. For convenience, simple logging is used to test the functions. To run the tests, just cd into the folder containing the .js file and run `node <fileName>.js` to run the tests.
